title: Process Mapping with The Lab Consulting
description: This is an example of the Process Mapping I've done with The Lab Consulting as an RPA Developer. We would create process maps in a series of meetings with our clients, then use them as guides for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) development.

## Key Features

- The key goals of my process mapping with The Lab Consulting was highlighting decision points, automation triggers, and system touchpoints.
- The most effective use of our process map was for RPA Development, where we would use the process map both as a list for deliverables and a guide for development.

## Challenges Faced

- Translating informal business processes into structured, standardized workflows.
- Identifying automation opportunities without introducing logical gaps or inefficiencies.
- Aligning stakeholder expectations with technical limitations during process refinement.
- Ensuring the process map remained adaptable for future updates and exceptions.
