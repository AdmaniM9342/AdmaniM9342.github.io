## Key Features

- The key goals of my process mapping with The Lab Consulting was highlighting decision points, automation triggers, and system touchpoints.
- The most effective use of our process map was for RPA Development, where we would use the process map both as a list for deliverables and a guide for development.

## Challenges Faced

- Translating informal business processes into structured, standardized workflows.
- Identifying automation opportunities without introducing logical gaps or inefficiencies.
- Aligning stakeholder expectations with technical limitations during process refinement.
- Ensuring the process map remained adaptable for future updates and exceptions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Process Modeling**: Built detailed maps that capture both human and digital workflows.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Identified inefficiencies and proposed structured improvements.
- **Tool Proficiency**: Applied UiPath and diagramming tools to support automation planning.
- **Technical Communication**: Translated complex workflows into accessible visual artifacts.
